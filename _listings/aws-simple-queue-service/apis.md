name: AWS Simple Queue Service
description: Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully
  managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to
  decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use Amazon SQS to transmit
  any volume of data, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always
  available. Amazon SQS includesnbsp;standard queuesnbsp;with high throughput and
  at-least-once processing, andnbsp;FIFO queuesnbsp;that provide FIFO (first-in, first-out)
  delivery and exactly-once processing. nbsp;nWith Amazon SQS, you can offload the
  administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available messaging cluster,
  while paying a low price for only what you use.
